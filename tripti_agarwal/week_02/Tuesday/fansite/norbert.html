       <h3> Intersting facts about him </h3>
      <li>
        In appearance and behavior, Norbert Wiener was a baroque figure, short, rotund, and myopic,
        combining these and many qualities in extreme degree. </li>
      <li>His conversation was a curious mixture of pomposity and wantonness. </li>
      <li> He was a poor listener. His self-praise was playful, convincing, and never offensive. </li>
      <li>He spoke many languages but was not easy to understand in any of them. </li>
      <li>  He was a famously bad lecturer.</li>
      <li>He died during a trip to Sweden and left two daughters. </li>
      <li>His wife was the former Margaret Engemann.</li>
